## Course overview
Research methods are our essential tools as social scientists. Our methodological capabilities help us address real world questions in a systematical and valid way.

This course focuses on the quantitative part of the universe of research methods for social scientists. The course aims to prepare students to conduct quantitative data analysis and to critically approach phenomena as researchers. The focus is on the capacity to conduct independent analyses using different types of data material, to interpret their results, and to understand and evaluate the assumptions on which the analyses rest.

The course consists of lectures, workshops, and exercises. The lectures will have a teacher driven review of a focused part of the theoretical course contents.

The workshops and exercises will focus on applying the methods from the curriculum and the contents from the lectures to solve data analytical problems. In addition to a focus on understanding and interpreting statistical methods, a key element will be the introduction to the statistical softwares R and RStudio.
