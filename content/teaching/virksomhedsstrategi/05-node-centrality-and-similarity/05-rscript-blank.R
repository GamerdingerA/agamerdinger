# Burt's constraint -------------------------------------------------------
# A measure of brokerage. It a measure on the node level that is higher for those that have less structural opportunities for bridging structural holes within a network. It measures how many direct ties of a node are redundant (connected with themselves). The more nodes are redundant, the more constraint a node is. 

# constraint - the higher, the less chances for brokerage

# Assortativity -----------------------------------------------------------
# Assortativity measures the extend to which nodes with similar properties are connected to each other. The assortativity coefficient ranges between -1 and 1, where 1 indicates that there is a high likelihood of two vertices with the same properties being connected. Networks that have an assortativity of 0 are usually referred to as neutral. 

# For categorical assortativity, we use the function assortativity_nominal()
# For continuous assortativity, we use the function assortativity()
# For assortativity based on degree we use the function assortativity_degree. It measures similarity on degree - e.g. those that have many friends also hang out with other popular people. 

# Assortativity degree for gr


# Assortativity degree for biggest component


# To calculate similarity between affiliations, we need to create a new variable - gender proportion. 

# What is the gender proportion?


# Let's aggregate gender proportions for each affiliation (but only look at women and men)
gender <- den1 %>% 
  #filter for women and men only
  filter(gender %in% c("Women", "Men")) %>% 
  #count amount of women and men per affiliation
  count(affiliation, gender) %>% 
  # do something, but group by affiliation first
  group_by(affiliation) %>% 
  # generates the total number of board members per affiliation
  mutate(n_total = sum(n), 
         # generates the share of women and men.
         share = n/(sum(n)))   

# Now, let us focus on one share: the share of men in the dataset. 
Men <- gender %>% filter(gender == "Men")
Women <- gender %>% filter(gender == "Women" & n == n_total)
Women$share = 0

Men <- Men %>% select(affiliation, share)

# create a common object

# Categorical Assortativity ------------------------------------------------
# let us create a categorical gender variable based on gender2.

# Template to add external variables to EliteDB ---------------------------

# Save this as an excel file where you can manually add a variable
write_xlsx(a1, 'output/template_external_variable.xlsx')
