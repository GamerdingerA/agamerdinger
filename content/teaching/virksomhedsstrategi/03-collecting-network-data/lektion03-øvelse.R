# set working directory, load libraries and the data set "den17-no-nordic-letters.csv"



# subset for sector = "Parliament" and select only linkers (or those that occur more than once in the data set)







# create a one-mode affiliation graph





# simplify the graph



# visualize the graph




# select the biggest component





# calculate the degree, closeness, betweenness and eigenvector centrality of all nodes and make a table. 





# Rank the table for each metric and try to find an explanation for why certain nodes are at the top. 





# Now, add the centrality measures to the graph object of the biggest component and visualize it. Make sure that you each attributes are given to the correct names. Show the node size by betweenness, and label nodes with a high betweenness value. Now, compare the explanation that you have just received before with the conclusions that you can draw from the graph.
