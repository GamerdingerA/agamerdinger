# subset for sector == "Corporations" and make another subset called den2 where you select only those that are at least in two boards at the same time


# Make a graph object of individuaks and find the biggest component of it. Visualize it. 


# Calculate density, transitivity, and the average distances of this component. How does it compare to the network we have looked at in class?


# What is the diameter of the biggest component? Can you visualize the diameter?
