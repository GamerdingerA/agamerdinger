I am a PhD Fellow in the [Department of Organization](https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-organization) at Copenhagen Business School. I study digitalization processes in insurance with a particular focus on the ethical adoption of novel algorithmic tools and techniques. My [research](/research/) is part of the [Algorithms, Data & Democracy](https://algoritmer.org/) consortium. For the 2024 winter semester, I am a [SCANCOR](https://scancor.org/) Visiting Researcher at Stanford University.
