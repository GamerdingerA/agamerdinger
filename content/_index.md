I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Techno-Anthropology Lab](https://www.en.culture.aau.dk/research/research-groups/tantlab) at [Aalborg University](https://vbn.aau.dk/en/persons/alexanderg/). I study how algorithms reshape markets and how public-sector AI infrastructures are designed, implemented, and governed. My [research](/research/) is part of the [Algorithms, Data & Democracy](https://algoritmer.org/) consortium.
