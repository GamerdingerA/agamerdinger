I am a PhD Fellow in the [Department of Organization](https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-organization) at Copenhagen Business School. I study digitalization processes in insurance with a focus on how 'data professionals' implement algorithmic risk classification systems, and how regulatory experts negotiate sector-specific guidelines for appropriate use of AI technology. I am part of the [Algorithms, Data & Democracy](https://algoritmer.org/) project.
