I am a PhD Fellow in the [Department of Organization](https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-organization) at Copenhagen Business School. I study the adoption of behavioral insurance in life insurance risk modelling practices by examining the expertise, regulatory governance and data ethical considerations needed to successfully adopt algorithmic systems. My [research](/research/) is part of the [Algorithms, Data & Democracy](https://algoritmer.org/) consortium.
