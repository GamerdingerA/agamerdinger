I am a Postdoc in the [Techno-Anthropology Lab](https://www.en.culture.aau.dk/research/research-groups/tantlab) at [Aalborg University](https://vbn.aau.dk/en/persons/alexanderg/). I study how algorithms reshape markets and how public sector AI infrastructures are developed and governed, drawing on economic sociology, science and technology studies and sociology of professions. My [research](/research/) is part of the [Algorithms, Data & Democracy](https://algoritmer.org/) consortium.
