description: 'My research is focused on professionals, algorithmic work and wellbeing-related issues'

<p>My research is focused on how the use of artificial intelligence and algorithms affect professional work, expertise, and the transnational governance of the insurance sector. Besides, I have a passion for happiness research and like to write and teach on issues related to subjective wellbeing, wellbeing governance and Wellbeing Economy.</p>
<p>My analytical approach is mostly quantitative, drawing on established methods found in Relational Sociology and International Political Economy including social network analysis, multiple correspondence analysis, and career sequence analysis. I am also interested in text mining, web scraping and data visualization.</p>
