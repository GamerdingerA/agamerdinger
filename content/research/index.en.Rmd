description: 'My research is focused on professionals, algorithmic work and wellbeing-related issues'
---

My research is focused on the sociotechnical dyanmics of digital technologies on the European insurance sector. More specifically, I am interested in how big data analytics and algorithms affect 1) the professional landscape, 2) the organizational structure, and 3) the governance of insurance in Europe.

As a part of the [Algorithms,Data & Democracy](https://algoritmer.org/) consortium, my empirical setting is mostly Denmark.

I employ mixed-method research methods to answer my research questions. While I have a background in quantitative methods including multivariate statistics (structural equations modelling, multiple correspondence analysis), social network analysis and text analysis, I also have a passion for ethnographic methods. I do not really have a preference of methods and adapt it to my research goals - I enjoy coding in R as well as by hand.
