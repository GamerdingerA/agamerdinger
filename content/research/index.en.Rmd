## Work in progress 

### Data is the new money: How data scientists gain authority in life insurance 

This study examines how data scientists become an increasingly important professional group that drives forth the behavioral insurance revolution in life insurance. In this paper, I investigate how data scientists adopt machine learning (ML) algorithms to drive claims prevention, and how this positions them as "new money professionals." The findings highlight that data scientists need to employ relational strategies, such as collaboration with health guides for domain expertise, strategic alliances with actuaries for financial validation, and governance specialists for compliance.This research underscores how an emerging professions must connect with multiple stakeholders to gain authority and drive forward the behavioral transformation. 

### From Risk Transfer to Risk Prevention: How field level dynamics shape AI innovation pathways

This paper examines the uneven adoption of AI innovations in the Danish life insurance sector, contrasting its limited use in individualizing pricing (risk transfer) with its broader success in preventing health risks (risk prevention). The findings highlight that risk prevention gained traction due to strong alignment of stakeholder values, including societal benefits and regulatory support, while risk transfer faced barriers such as concerns about fairness, uninsurability, and reputational risks. The study emphasizes the importance of field-level legitimacy and strategic coordination in fostering innovation pathways. It sheds light on how shared norms and coordinated actions shape the adoption of AI technologies in regulated industries.
