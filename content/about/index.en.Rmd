description: 'I am Alexander, a PhD Fellow at Copenhagen Business School'
---

I am a PhD student at the [Department of Organization](https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-organization/staff/agaioa) at Copenhagen Business School. 

As part of the [Algorithms,Data & Democracy](https://algoritmer.org/) consortium, I study how 'data professionals' and regulatory experts organize the ethical adoption of novel algorithmic tools and techniques in the insurance sector. I am interested in the ways in which professional decisions, morals, and judgments shape and appropriate classification systems and their social implications.

My research explores two specific contexts. The first context focuses on the regulatory governance of AI in the European Union, where I analyze how regulatory experts translate EU-wide governance initiatives, such as the AI Act or the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI, into practical governance standards for practitioners that clarify which AI systems are morally acceptable. The second context focuses on algorithmic practices in insurance companies, where I examine how 'data professionals' adopt novel risk classification systems. Specifically, I examine the 'cultural machinery' of actuaries and data scientists and how they mobilize risk technologies as instruments of expertise, morality, and legal control.

Methodologically, I conduct mixed methods research, including participant observation, interviews, statistical analysis, and spatial quantitative analyses such as network analysis or multiple correspondence analysis.

I have a background from Copenhagen Business School, where I received my BSc and MSc degrees in International Business and Politics. For the winter semester 2024, I am a Visiting Researcher at Stanford University, associated with the [SCANCOR](https://scancor.org/about/) program. Before starting my Ph.D., I was an analyst at the [Happiness Research Institute](https://www.happinessresearchinstitute.com/), and I continue to actively follow the wellbeing and post-growth political movement.
