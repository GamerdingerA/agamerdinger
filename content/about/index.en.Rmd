description: 'I am Alexander, a PhD Fellow at Copenhagen Business School'
---

I am a PhD Fellow at the [Department of Organization](https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-organization/staff/agaioa) at Copenhagen Business School. While I have a background in International Political Economy, my research is situated in Economic Sociology, Sociology of Professions and Sociology of Insurance. My research is part of the [Algorithms,Data & Democracy](https://algoritmer.org/) consortium, which includes several danish universities and the think-tank Mandag Morgen. 

In my spare time, I am passionate about coding in R, following the wellbeing and post-growth movement, and swimming. 

If you would like to know more about me, check out my [CV](251022 CV-Alexander.pdf), [blog](/blog/) or send me an e-mail at [aga.ioa\@cbs.dk](mailto:aga.ioa@cbs.dk){.email}
