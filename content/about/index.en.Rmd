I am a PhD Fellow at the [Department of Organization](https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-organization/staff/agaioa) at Copenhagen Business School. I have a BSc and MSc in International Business and Politics from CBS specializing in International Political Economy and wellbeing indicators.

After my education, I started a PhD fellowship at CBS where I research the use of data and new technologies in insurance. Theoretically, I draw on Sociology of Professions and Sociology of Insurance. My research is part of the [Algorithms,Data & Democracy](https://algoritmer.org/) project which includes several university in Denmark. 

In my spare time, I am passionate about coding in R, following the wellbeing and post-growth movement, and swimming.
