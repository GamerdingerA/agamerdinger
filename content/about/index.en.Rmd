description: 'I am Alexander, a research assistant at Copenhagen Business School'
---

I am a research assistant at the [Department of Organization](https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-organization/staff/agaioa) at Copenhagen Business School. My research is primarily focused on professionals and algorithmic work in the insurance industry. I am fully funded by the [Algorithms,Data & Democracy](https://algoritmer.org/) project. 

In my spare time, I write, teach and talk about subjective wellbeing, happiness and the Wellbeing Economy. This is a remainder of my prior work with my wonderful and talented collegaues at the [Happiness Research Institute](https://happinessresearchinstitute.com), a Copenhagen based think tank. 

Analytically, I am interested in statistics and relational methods such as social network analysis. I enjoy coding in R. Some of this work, I am sharing on my [blog](/blog/).
