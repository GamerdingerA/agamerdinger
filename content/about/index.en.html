description: 'I am Alexander, a PhD Fellow at Copenhagen Business School'
---



<p>I am a PhD Fellow at the <a href="https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-organization/staff/agaioa">Department of Organization</a> at Copenhagen Business School. While I have a background in International Political Economy, my research is situated in Economic Sociology, Sociology of Professions and Sociology of Insurance. I am researching the sociotechnical dyanmics of digital technologies on the European insurance sector. More specifically, I am interested in how big data analytics and algorithms affect 1) the professional landscape, 2) the organizational structure, and 3) the governance of insurance in Europe.</p>
<p>As a part of the <a href="https://algoritmer.org/">Algorithms,Data &amp; Democracy</a> consortium, my empirical setting is mostly Denmark.</p>
<p>I employ mixed-method research methods to answer my research questions. While I have a background in quantitative methods including multivariate statistics (structural equations modelling, multiple correspondence analysis), social network analysis and text analysis, I also have a passion for ethnographic methods. I do not really have a preference of methods and adapt it to my research goals - I enjoy coding in R as well as by hand.</p>
