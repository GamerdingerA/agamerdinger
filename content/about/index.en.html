<p>I am a PhD Fellow at the <a href="https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-organization/staff/agaioa">Department of Organization</a> at Copenhagen Business School. While I have a background in International Political Economy, my research is situated in Economic Sociology, Sociology of Professions and Sociology of Insurance. My research is part of the <a href="https://algoritmer.org/">Algorithms,Data &amp; Democracy</a> consortium, which includes several danish universities and the think-tank Mandag Morgen.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I am passionate about coding in R, following the wellbeing and post-growth movement, and swimming.</p>
