<p>I am a research assistant at the <a href="https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-organization/staff/agaioa">Department of Organization</a> at Copenhagen Business School. My research is primarily focused on professionals and algorithmic work in the insurance industry. I am fully funded by the <a href="https://algoritmer.org/">Algorithms,Data &amp; Democracy</a> project. See more in my <a href="/index.en_files/CV_AG.pdf">CV</a>.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I write, teach and talk about subjective wellbeing, happiness and the Wellbeing Economy. This is a remainder of my prior work with my wonderful and talented collegaues at the <a href="https://happinessresearchinstitute.com">Happiness Research Institute</a>, a Copenhagen based think tank.</p>
<p>Analytically, I am interested in statistics and relational methods such as social network analysis. I enjoy coding in R. Some of this work, I am sharing on my <a href="/blog/">blog</a>.</p>
