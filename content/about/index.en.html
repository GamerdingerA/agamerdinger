<p>I am a PhD Fellow at the <a href="https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-organization/staff/agaioa">Department of Organization</a> at Copenhagen Business School. My research is primarily focused on professionals and algorithmic work in the insurance industry. I am fully funded by the <a href="https://algoritmer.org/">Algorithms,Data &amp; Democracy</a> project.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I write, teach and talk about subjective wellbeing, happiness and the Wellbeing Economy. This is a remainder of my prior work with my talented colleagues at the <a href="https://happinessresearchinstitute.com">Happiness Research Institute</a>, a Copenhagen based Think Tank.</p>
<p>I enjoy working with quantitative data, using statistical methods, social network analysis and text analysis in R.</p>
